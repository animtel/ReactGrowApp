## About project:

This is a simple project, which simulate the real life situations. Here implemented basic CRUD operations with contacts which have a name, email and phone. I was working with the components, jsx, props, state, context api, forms, react router, lifecycle of components, http requests, composition approach etc.

For simulate db i was using this site https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/ which provide some json data. Thats why, if you will change, add or delete contact, after reload the page, they return back...)
